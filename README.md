HTML Overview
    *Elements are containers (grammar)
        *Elements can have either more elements or text (text nodes)
        *Types of elements
            *Block level -> div, p, h1, h6
            *Inline elements -> strong, em, span
            *Void elements -> br, meta, hr
        *Rules
            *block within block (valid)
            *inline within inline (valid)
            *inline within black (valid)
            *Are void elements block elements (some of them -> br, hr) 
            *Block within inline (invalid)
        *Attributes (describe elements)
            *examples: class, id, src, href
            *2 types
                *Required: a -> href, 
                *Optional: p -> class
              
              
        Without erros vs Valid
            *Well-formed documents
               - Have correc syntax
            *Mal-formed document
               - A non-void element must have a closing
         *Valid document / Invalid document
            * We need to follow the rules defined by the doctype
